🌍 Life Expectancy Prediction using Machine Learning

A supervised machine learning project that predicts Life Expectancy Categories (Low, Medium, High) of countries using socio-economic and health indicators from the World Bank dataset.

📌 Project Overview

Life expectancy is a key indicator of a nation’s overall development and healthcare quality. This project applies predictive analytics and supervised learning to analyze real-world data and classify countries into meaningful life expectancy groups.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess real-world life expectancy data

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key influencing factors

Build and compare multiple supervised learning models

Evaluate models using standard classification metrics

Identify the best-performing model for prediction

🏆 Best Model

The Decision Tree Classifier delivered the best overall performance by effectively capturing non-linear relationships in the dataset and achieving higher accuracy and F1-score.

🔮 Key Findings

Most countries fall under the Medium life expectancy category

Health and economic indicators strongly influence life expectancy

The model showed strong agreement between actual and predicted values

📈 Output
